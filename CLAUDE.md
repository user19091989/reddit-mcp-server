# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a read-only fork of a Reddit MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides tools for interacting with the Reddit API. It's built with TypeScript and uses FastMCP to expose Reddit functionality as tools that can be used by AI assistants. All write tools have been removed; the server only reads public content and authenticates with OAuth app credentials (no Reddit user credentials).

## Available Tools

### Read-only Tools

- `get_top_posts` - Get top posts from a subreddit or home feed (**works via RSS without credentials**)
- `browse_subreddit` - Browse a subreddit or home feed by sort order (hot, new, top, rising, controversial); `time_filter` applies only to top/controversial (**works via RSS without credentials**)
- `get_reddit_post` - Get a specific Reddit post with engagement analysis (OAuth required)
- `get_user_info` - Get detailed information about a Reddit user
- `get_subreddit_info` - Get subreddit details, stats, and community insights
- `get_subreddit_rules` - Get a subreddit's posting rules
- `get_post_flairs` - List a subreddit's available link flairs (may 403 on restricted subreddits)
- `get_trending_subreddits` - Get currently trending/popular subreddits
- `search_reddit` - Search for posts, subreddits (`type=sr`), or users (`type=user`) across Reddit with filters
- `get_post_comments` - Get comments from a specific post with threading
- `get_more_comments` - Expand truncated "load more" comment stubs via /api/morechildren
- `get_user_posts` - Get posts submitted by a specific user
- `get_user_comments` - Get comments made by a specific user
- `test_reddit_mcp_server` - Local health check (no Reddit API calls)

### Server Modes

The server supports two transport modes:

1. **HTTP Server (Default)**: Runs on port 3000 with `/mcp` endpoint
   - Used for Docker deployments and direct execution
   - Access via: `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
   - SSE endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/sse`

2. **Stdio Mode**: For CLI and npx usage
   - Automatically enabled when using `npx reddit-mcp-server` or the bin entry point
   - Used for integration with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Reddit Client** (`src/client/reddit-client.ts`): Singleton pattern implementation that handles:
   - OAuth2 client-credentials authentication (app-only; no user credentials)
   - Automatic token refresh via 401 re-auth
   - Rate limiting and error handling
   - RSS fallback routing when no OAuth credentials are available
   - Read-only operations only

2. **RSS Client** (`src/client/rss-client.ts`): Zero-credential fallback that parses Reddit's Atom feeds:
   - Parses Atom 1.0 XML via `fast-xml-parser` (attributes preserved with `@_` prefix)
   - Maps Atom entries to `RedditPost` (score/numComments/upvoteRatio are 0 — RSS has no metrics)
   - Handles `fast-xml-parser`'s dual content shape (string vs `{#text, @_type}` object)
   - Returns `Page<RedditPost>` with `source: "rss"` for downstream disclaimer rendering
   - Returns typed `RedditError` (`HttpError` / `UnknownError`), not bare `Error`

3. **Server and Tools** (`src/index.ts`): There is no `src/tools/` directory — every MCP tool is registered here with `server.addTool`:
   - Shared render helpers: `formatPostSummary`, `nextPageHint`, `rssDisclaimer`
   - Client setup (`setupRedditClient`) and transport startup (stdio or httpStream)
   - `src/bin.ts` is the npx/CLI entry point: it forces stdio mode and handles `--help`/`--version`

4. **Formatters** (`src/utils/formatters.ts`): Turn client types into display shapes:
   - `formatPostInfo`: a link post shows its body text and then its URL; only the body is truncated
   - `formatCommentInfo(comment, maxLength = 5000)`: comment tools pass their own limit (300 for user comments and more-comments)
   - `truncateText`: shared cut-to-length helper; the result includes the `...`
   - Engagement and health analysis helpers

5. **Type Definitions** (`src/types.ts`): Comprehensive TypeScript types for all Reddit entities

### Authentication Flow

**Reddit now requires OAuth credentials for all API access** (mid-2026). Anonymous/unauthenticated requests are blocked with HTTP 403 across all networks. Self-service app creation at `/prefs/apps` was closed in November 2025 — new developers must request access through Reddit Developer Support.

The server supports three authentication modes configured via `REDDIT_AUTH_MODE`:

1. **auto (default)**: Uses OAuth when credentials are provided, RSS fallback otherwise
   - With REDDIT_CLIENT_ID + REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET: full API access at 60-100 req/min
   - Without credentials: falls back to RSS feeds for `browse_subreddit` and `get_top_posts` only (~1 req/min, no metrics)
   - All other tools return `NotAuthenticatedError` directing the user to set up OAuth

2. **authenticated**: Explicitly requires OAuth credentials
   - Server fails to start if credentials are missing
   - 60-100 req/min
   - Use for production environments

3. **anonymous** (deprecated): Alias for the RSS fallback path
   - Behaves identically to `auto` without credentials (RSS only)
   - Emits deprecation warning at startup

### Response Caching (Rate-Limit Relief)

Read-only GET requests are cached in-memory to reduce pressure on Reddit's tight rate limits (~10 req/min anonymous, 60-100 authenticated). Configured via `REDDIT_CACHE` (default `on`, set `off` to disable) and `REDDIT_CACHE_MAX_MB` (default `50`).

- **Adaptive TTLs** (`src/client/response-cache.ts`): volatile listings (hot/new/rising) and comment threads cache for 60s; top/controversial, search, and user/subreddit `about` cache for 300s; everything else 120s.
- **Bounded LRU**: total cached bytes are capped at `REDDIT_CACHE_MAX_MB`; least-recently-used entries are evicted first. A single response larger than the cap is never cached.
- **Scope**: only successful `GET` responses are cached, keyed by full URL. Auth requests are never cached. The cache layer lives in `RedditClient.makeRequest`, which re-wraps cached bodies in a fresh `Response` (a fetch body can only be consumed once).
- Only active when enabled; when disabled the client behaves exactly as before (raw `Response` passthrough).

### Identifier Validation (Path Injection)

Every subreddit, username, and thing ID is model-supplied, so `src/utils/reddit-identifiers.ts` normalizes and validates each one before it reaches a URL. Interpolating them raw was a path-injection hole: URL parsing resolves dot segments, so a `subreddit` of `../../api/v1/me` escapes `/r/{sub}/about.json` and steers the OAuth bearer token to a different endpoint, and an embedded `?`/`&` injects query parameters.

- **`normalizeSubreddit`** — strips `r/`, `/r/`, trailing slashes; allows `+`-joined multireddits and `u_` profile subreddits; `""` still means the home feed.
- **`normalizeUsername`** — strips `u/`, `/u/`, `/user/`.
- **`normalizeThingId` / `normalizeFullname`** — bare base36 id, or a `t1_`/`t3_` fullname with the explicit kind preserved over the supplied default.
- Every returned value matches `[A-Za-z0-9_+-]+`, which is already URL-path-safe. No `encodeURIComponent` is applied, because encoding the `+` in `r/science+space` would break it.
- Validators throw `ValidationError` from inside the `Try` bodies in `reddit-client.ts`, so failures surface as a `Left` before any request is made — including before the auth call.

### Rate-Limit Retry (429)

`RedditClient.makeRequest` transparently retries HTTP 429 responses. Configured via `REDDIT_MAX_RETRIES` (default `3`, set `0` to disable).

- **Delay**: honors `Retry-After` (delta-seconds or HTTP-date), then `x-ratelimit-reset`; otherwise exponential backoff (`baseDelayMs * 2^attempt`).
- **Cap**: a single wait is bounded by `maxDelayMs` (60s); if the required wait exceeds the cap, it gives up and surfaces the typed `HttpError(429)` rather than blocking.
- **Implementation**: `fetchWithRetry` is recursive (functional style — no mutable loop) and `retryAfterMs` returns `Option<number>`. The 401 re-auth path also flows through it, so a post-reauth request gets 429 handling too.
- Retries apply to all requests; a 429 means the request was rejected, so retrying is safe.

### Pagination

Listing tools (`get_top_posts`, `browse_subreddit`, `search_reddit`, `get_user_posts`, `get_user_comments`) support Reddit's cursor pagination.

- Each accepts an optional `after` param (the cursor from a previous page) to fetch the next page.
- The client methods return `Page<T>` (`src/types.ts`): `{ items, after?, before? }`. `after`/`before` are surfaced only when Reddit returns a string cursor (its `null` is dropped), parsed by `listingCursor` in `RedditClient`.
- The MCP tools render `items` and append a "More results available — call again with after=…" footer (`nextPageHint`) when `page.after` is present, so an agent can walk pages.
- Forward paging only for now (`after`); `before` is returned but not yet accepted as input.

## Environment Setup

Environment variables:

```bash
# Reddit API Credentials (required — Reddit blocks unauthenticated requests since mid-2026)
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=YourApp/1.0.0  # Optional, defaults to an auto-generated agent

# Authentication Mode (optional, defaults to 'auto'; 'anonymous' is deprecated)
REDDIT_AUTH_MODE=auto            # Options: auto, authenticated, anonymous

# Response Caching (optional, defaults to 'on')
REDDIT_CACHE=on                  # Options: on, off
REDDIT_CACHE_MAX_MB=50           # Cache size cap in MB (LRU eviction beyond this)

# Rate-Limit Retry (optional, defaults to 3)
REDDIT_MAX_RETRIES=3             # Retries on HTTP 429 with Retry-After backoff (0 disables)

# Transport Configuration
# TRANSPORT_TYPE=stdio            # Uncomment for stdio mode (default: httpStream for node, stdio for npx/bin)
PORT=3000                          # HTTP server port (default: 3000)

# OAuth Authentication (for HTTP server)
OAUTH_ENABLED=true                # Set to "true" to enable OAuth protection
OAUTH_TOKEN=your_secret_token     # Optional, will generate random token if not provided
```

### Quick Start Examples

**Zero-setup (RSS fallback, browse/top only):**

```bash
npx reddit-mcp-server
```

**Full access (OAuth):**

```bash
export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
npx reddit-mcp-server
```

### Transport Modes

The server defaults to stdio mode for MCP client compatibility:

- **Running directly**: `node dist/index.js` → stdio mode (default)
- **Running via npx**: `npx reddit-mcp-server` → stdio mode
- **Running via Docker**: Set `TRANSPORT_TYPE=httpStream` for HTTP server on port 3000
- **Force HTTP mode**: Set `TRANSPORT_TYPE=httpStream` or `TRANSPORT_TYPE=http`

### OAuth Security

The HTTP server supports optional OAuth protection:

- **Disabled by default**: The server runs without authentication
- **Enable with**: `OAUTH_ENABLED=true`
- **Token options**:
  - Provide your own: `OAUTH_TOKEN=your-secure-token`
  - Auto-generate: Server creates a random 32-character token on startup
- **Usage**: Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header in requests to `/mcp`

Example request with OAuth:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Error Handling**: All tools use try-catch blocks and return MCP-compliant error responses
2. **Rate Limiting**: Built into the Reddit client to respect API limits
3. **Token Refresh**: Automatic when tokens expire via authentication checks
4. **Singleton Client**: Ensures single authenticated instance across all tools
5. **Thing IDs**: Reddit uses prefixed IDs (t3* for posts, t1* for comments). The client methods handle both prefixed and non-prefixed IDs automatically.
6. **Read-Only by Design**: No write methods exist on the client; `authenticate()` only ever requests the `client_credentials` grant.

### Intentionally Excluded (Policy Compliance)

The following Reddit API capabilities are intentionally NOT implemented per Reddit's Responsible Builder Policy:

- **All write operations**: create/edit/delete posts and comments, replies, saving — removed in this read-only fork
- **Direct Messages/Private Messages**: Bots must get explicit consent for private communications
- **Voting (upvote/downvote)**: Manipulating Reddit features like voting or karma is prohibited
- **Bulk data export/scraping**: Reddit data must not be scraped for AI training or commercialized without approval

## Testing Approach

The project uses Vitest for testing:

- **Run tests**: `pnpm test`
- **Watch mode**: `pnpm test:watch`
- **Coverage**: `pnpm test:coverage`
- **Manual testing**: Use the MCP inspector (`pnpm inspect`)
- Test both authenticated and unauthenticated flows
- Verify error handling for invalid inputs and API failures

## Common Development Tasks

1. **Adding a new Reddit tool**:
   - Add method to RedditClient class (`src/client/reddit-client.ts`)
   - Define TypeScript types in `src/types.ts` if needed
   - Create MCP tool in main server (`src/index.ts`)
   - Add tests to `src/client/__tests__/reddit-client.test.ts`
   - Update documentation (README.md and CLAUDE.md)

2. **Modifying Reddit client**:
   - Update `src/client/reddit-client.ts`
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing tools
   - Test both auth flows if authentication logic changes
   - Add comprehensive tests for new functionality

3. **Debugging**:
   - Use `pnpm inspect` to test tools interactively
   - Check authentication flow for auth issues
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - Review console.error logs for Reddit API responses

## Releasing / Version Bumping

**CRITICAL**: Three files must stay in lockstep on every release:

- `package.json` — `.version`
- `server.json` — `.version` AND `.packages[0].version`
- `manifest.json` — `.version`

`npm version <patch|minor|major>` only bumps `package.json`. CI's `prepublishOnly` runs `pnpm check:versions` and **will fail the publish** if the other two drift (this has bitten v1.4.6 — see commit `49f232e`).

### Correct release workflow

```bash
# 1. Make sure check:versions passes BEFORE bumping
pnpm check:versions

# 2. Bump package.json without committing/tagging yet
npm version patch --no-git-tag-version

# 3. Hand-edit server.json (both version fields) and manifest.json to match
#    Or use sed/jq — the file structure is stable

# 4. Verify, validate, then commit + tag together
pnpm check:versions
pnpm validate
git add package.json server.json manifest.json pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "x.y.z"
# -a matters: --follow-tags pushes ANNOTATED tags only (see below)
git tag -a "v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")" -m "v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")"
git push --follow-tags

# 5. Confirm the tag actually landed — the publish workflow triggers on the tag, not on main
git ls-remote --tags origin | grep "v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")"
```

**GOTCHA: a lightweight tag is silently not pushed.** `git push --follow-tags` pushes only _annotated_ tags, so a bare `git tag v1.5.2` stays local. The commit goes up, `git push` reports success, and the publish workflow never fires — no error anywhere. This bit v1.5.2. Either tag with `-a` as above, or push the tag explicitly:

```bash
git push origin "v$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")"
```

If you find a released commit on `main` with no npm publish, this is the first thing to check.

If you edit these JSON files with a script, run `pnpm format` afterwards — `JSON.stringify(j, null, 2)` expands Prettier's collapsed arrays and produces a noisy diff.

### Or: use the `vbctp` skill, but stage the JSON files first

The `vbctp` skill runs `pnpm validate` → `npm version patch` → `git push --follow-tags`. `pnpm validate` does NOT include `pnpm check:versions` — only `prepublishOnly` does, which means the mismatch is only caught in CI. **Before invoking vbctp, bump server.json + manifest.json by hand and stage them**; `npm version` will then refuse to run (dirty tree), so commit those changes first, then run vbctp.

`npm version` creates an annotated tag, so vbctp's `--follow-tags` does push it. The lightweight-tag trap above applies only when you tag by hand.

### Long-term fix (not yet implemented)

A `"version"` npm lifecycle script can auto-sync the two JSON files and `git add` them, making `npm version patch` atomic. Pattern:

```json
"scripts": {
  "version": "tsx scripts/sync-versions.ts && git add server.json manifest.json"
}
```

Until that exists, treat the three-file sync as a manual checklist item.
