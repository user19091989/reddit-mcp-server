/**
 * Typed error channel for the Reddit client.
 *
 * The client's methods are the imperative-to-functional boundary: each captures throws
 * (network, HTTP, JSON parsing, validation, deliberate domain errors) inside a `Try` and
 * converts to a typed `Either<RedditError, T>`. Modelling the error as a discriminated ADT
 * — rather than a bare `Error` — makes the failure contract explicit at the type level, so
 * callers can reason about (and branch on) what actually went wrong without string-matching.
 *
 * `classifyRedditError` is TOTAL and never re-throws — every captured `Error` maps to a
 * variant — which is what makes the migration behavior-preserving: an error that was a
 * graceful `Left` before is still a graceful `Left` after, just with a richer type.
 *
 * Two-tier behavior, to preserve the exact messages of the original try/catch code:
 *  - A *deliberate* typed throw (HttpError, NotFoundError, …) already carries its final
 *    message, so it passes through unchanged.
 *  - An *unexpected* generic error (fetch/JSON/orThrow) is wrapped as UnknownError, with the
 *    optional `context` prefix — present for read methods (which prefixed in their catch),
 *    absent otherwise.
